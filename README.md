# react_pack

Simple, unified, stable set of React dependencies to abstract Node projects.

# What?

Stable, dependency, base for simplifying Node scaffolds.

# How Do I Use This?

Using Node: `8.8.0`

```
{
	//...
	"devDependencies": {
		"react_pack": "git+https://github.com/Thoughtscript/react_pack.git"
	},
	/...
}
```

Then, since those dependencies live in your `node_modules`, you can `require` or `import` them normally. Hooray!
